    <h2>WE WANT TO HELP</h2>

    <p>
        Pets stay with their owners through hardship and can sometimes be their only companion. When pet owners can't look after their pets financially, the only option is to give them up for adoption. Leaving the owners who are usually elderly and disabled heart broken.
        We want to make sure that there are other options.
    </p>
